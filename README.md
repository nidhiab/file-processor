# file-processor
File Processor Application

This application processes a file - records.csv that is placed in the resources folder.
This file has records as specified in the challenge brief.

The repository has a folder called apidocs, that has generated javadocs.

I have tested this app on java 11 and 15. 

It can be built using mvn

The command to use is 
mvn install
It uses whatever jdk is set in your JAVA_HOME

As a result of above command two jars get created. You would want to use the executable jar called file-processor.jar for testing purposes.
